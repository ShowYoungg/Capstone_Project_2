## Project Overview
I did productionize an app, taking it from application planning stage to a production-ready state. This involves full responsibility of development lifecycle like thinking of an app idea, drawing the whiteboard, designing and developement, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, I often have to create and implement apps where I am responsible for full development lifecycle like designing and planning the steps I need to take to create a production-ready app.

## App features
This is a Finance app that deals with management of stocks, cash and expenses and does necessary accounting calculations and postings.

Inventory and Stock Account Manager is an app that manages inventory, helps keep track of the flow of inventory i.e how inventories of different sort go in and out, the unit cost price and sales price; and generates accounting records such as Purchase and Sales Journals, Account Receivables and Account Payables, Price List, Profit and Loss Account.

This app also ensure Cash and Bank accounts are kept; this feature can be used as a stand alone or with the other functions of the app like management of inventories.

In addition, Expenses like sales expenses and general expenses are kept. This feature enables the app to prepare Trading, Profit and Loss Accounts and ensures Sales Expenses are separated from other expenses.

This app ensures:

Accounting record of stocks are kept.

Price list that features cost price and selling price is featured.
Stock inflow and outflow management. 
Cash Book and Bank Statement are prepared.
Account Receivables and Payables are prepared.
Trading, Profit and Loss account is generated.
Accounting records of all sales and purchases are kept.
Accounting records for debtors and creditors are kept.
Product pictures are also featured.
All records can be exported to csv file which will be saved on device memory in the directory of Inventory and the file name is excel.csv
The app can also import pre populated csv file, all entries, postings and accounting records will be made automatically. 

It is noteworthy to first input some data into the app and export to a csv file in order to know the order in which data is arranged and populated in the csv; this will enable users to know how to populate the csv for future import into the app.
