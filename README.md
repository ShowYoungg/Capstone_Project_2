## Project Overview
I did productionize an app, taking it from application planning stage to a production-ready state. This involves full responsibility of development lifecycle like thinking of an app idea, drawing the whiteboard, designing and developement, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, I often have to create and implement apps where I am responsible for full development lifecycle like designing and planning the steps I need to take to create a production-ready app.

## App features
This is a Finance app that deals with management of stocks, cash and expenses and does necessary accounting calculations and postings.

Inventory and Stock Account Manager is an app that manages inventory, helps keep track of the flow of inventory i.e how inventories of different sort go in and out, the unit cost price and sales price; and generates accounting records such as Purchase and Sales Journals, Account Receivables and Account Payables, Price List, Profit and Loss Account.

This app also ensure Cash and Bank accounts are kept; this feature can be used as a stand alone or with the other functions of the app like management of inventories.
