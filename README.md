## Project Overview
I did productionize an app, taking it from application planning stage to a production-ready state. This involves full responsibility of development lifecycle like thinking of an app idea, drawing the whiteboard, designing and developement, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, I often have to create and implement apps where I am responsible for full development lifecycle like designing and planning the steps I need to take to create a production-ready app.
